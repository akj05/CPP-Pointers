🎯 Pointers in C++
🧭 AIM
To understand and implement pointers in C++, exploring their behavior, arithmetic, and applications in memory manipulation and data access.

📚 THEORY
📌 What Are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It allows indirect access and manipulation of data, enabling dynamic memory management and efficient data handling.

Declared using * (e.g., int *ptr)
Initialized with address using & (e.g., ptr = &a)
Dereferenced using *ptr to access the value
📌 Pointer Arithmetic
Pointers can be incremented or decremented to traverse memory, especially useful with arrays.

ptr++ moves to the next memory block based on data type size
Subtracting pointers gives the number of elements between them
🔄 Common Operations
Operation	Description
Dereferencing	Accessing the value at the pointed address
Address Access	Using & to get the memory location
Pointer Arithmetic	Incrementing or comparing pointer positions
Swapping Values	Using pointers to exchange data in-place
Array Traversal	Iterating using pointers instead of indices
⚙️ Best Practices and Optimization Tips
✅ Always initialize pointers before use to avoid undefined behavior.
✅ Use pointer arithmetic carefully, respecting memory boundaries.
✅ Prefer smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) in modern C++ for safety.
✅ Avoid dangling pointers—ensure memory is valid before access.
✅ Use pointers for efficient in-place operations like swapping or reversing.

📋 Algorithms
✅ Reverse an Array Using Pointers
Declare array arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Set start = arr, end = arr + size - 1
While start < end:
Swap *start and *end
Increment start, decrement end
Print reversed array
✅ Reverse a String Using Pointers
Input string using cin.getline()
Calculate length using strlen()
Set pointer to last character
While pointer ≥ start of string:
Print *ptr
Decrement pointer
✅ Pointer Arithmetic Across Data Types
Declare variables of types int, float, char, bool
Assign pointers to each
Print pointer before and after increment
Observe memory jump based on data type size
✅ Value Difference vs Pointer Distance
Declare array arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
Set ptr1 = &arr[4], ptr2 = &arr[1]
Calculate *ptr1 - *ptr2 → value difference
Calculate ptr1 - ptr2 → index difference
Print both
🧠 CONCLUSION
Pointers in C++ allow direct memory manipulation, enabling efficient and flexible programming. Understanding their basics—dereferencing, arithmetic, and safe usage—forms a foundation for advanced concepts like dynamic allocation, data structures, and system-level coding.
